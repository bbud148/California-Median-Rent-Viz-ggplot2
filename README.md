# California-Median-Rent-Viz
This project is a simple visualization of median rent in California, USA using Census.gov data and shapefiles.  The project is based off the tutorial found [here](http://www.kevjohnson.org/making-maps-in-r/) by Kevin Johnson and uses California insted of Georgia, among other tweaks.  The language used for the project is R, with a focus on the ggplot2 package.

I decided on creating this map to sharpen my skills with mapping using ggplot and shapefiles, both important tools in creating smart maps.
